Yeah, so I think we're on track, but there's still quite a bit to do. Absolutely. And I'm concerned about the motor design. Who's going to define the motor geometry? I can take that on, but I'm still waiting on some calculations from thrust analysis. Speaking of which, has anyone made a decision on propellant yet? We really need to choose the type of solid fuel soon. I was leaning towards apcp, but I'm open to suggestions if anyone has experience with alternatives. Before we get too far ahead, can someone please draw an electronics diagram for the sensors? I'm having trouble visualizing how everything connects. I'll handle that this weekend. By the way, who's going to test the Arduino? We need to make sure the code works before integration. I can do that. I've got one at home. Great. Oh, and we still need to build the test stand, right? The materials arrived yesterday. Yeah, I'll start on that tomorrow. But we'll need help with the assembly once it's built. Don't forget we need to strength test the test stand. Last year's failure was pretty spectacular. And not in a good way. Definitely don't want a repeat of that. I'll set up the hydraulic press for testing.
