And tell me what we need to do today. Okay. We have some other things to do. I'm gonna eat some chips, and I'll do that by tomorrow. Marius, you should drink a Celsius in two days. And then make sure you build the entire static test stand in the next seven days. Do you think we could push that to nine days? Yeah, we could push that to nine days. So in nine days, it'll be March 30th, okay?
